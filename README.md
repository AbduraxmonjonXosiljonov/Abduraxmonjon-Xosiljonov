# Aws_mini_project final
The project is about to build a web application employing Flask and PostgreSQL backed by AWS RDS. The idea is to present a list of courses which will be retrieved from the interfacing database.

In development, all necessary steps were taken, including the creation of Flask application instance, setting up of the RDS Database instance, and using of Bootsrap in front-end. However, through my efforts I can only get the “No courses available” on the table because of data reading problem in the database.

Styling was done by Bootstrap due to personal preference and having studied frontend development and as a way to demonstrate my capability. More detail can be provided on the GitHub account that I will present in class.

The result of the project is visible in the screenshot below:
